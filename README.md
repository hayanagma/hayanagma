### 💼 Professional Work
Independently built and deployed a fully operational **modular backend** for a gaming and transactional platform featuring **microservice isolation**, **centralized authentication**, **inter-service communication via Redis**, **SQL persistence with Flyway migrations**, **reactive WebFlux architecture**, and **containerized orchestration through Docker and Kubernetes**.  
Due to confidentiality, the full production system cannot be shared publicly, but **code samples and architectural overviews** are available on request.

Additionally, I have developed multiple **backend applications and internal systems** across various domains.  
Source code for client projects is not publicly available due to confidentiality agreements.
